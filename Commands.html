3) Multiple python versions are allowed over a single system

4) If want to install django in any particular version then use command - python -m pip install Django

5) command is used to manage Django projects and applications. It provides a range of commands to help with various development and administrative tasks - django-admin

6) Command to start a new project - Django-admin startproject BlogApp

7) There are two folders with the same name BlogApp the main one is the name of the directory and the inside one is the name of the project.

8) __init__.py is an empty file , the presence of this file in a directory signals to Python that this directory should be treated as a package. This allows you to import modules from this directory.

9) settings.py contains the settings of our project

10) urls.py contains the mappings and all

11) wsgi.py web server gateway interface

13) manage.py is a command line utility helps us to interact with the Django Project 

14) python manage.py runserver command is used to start the Django development server or can say to run the manage.
py file 

15) py -m venv (name of environment) - command to create virtual environment so that the project related packages do not interfere with the global ones

17) django-admin startproject (Project name) - Command to start a new project in the folder

18) django-admin startapp (app name) - Command to start a new app in the folder
we can create multiple apps inside a project because Each app handles a specific feature or part of your project, making it easier to find and work on code.
 b) You can reuse apps in different projects. For example, if you create a blog app, you can use it in other projects without rewriting the code.

21) MVT(Model View Template) architecture of Django
In Django's MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture, 
Models are crucial for:

 a)Data Representation: Define the structure of your database, representing tables and fields.
 b)Data Manipulation: Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and complex queries using Django's ORM.
 c)Validation: Ensure data integrity through built-in and custom validation.
 d)Business Logic: Encapsulate business logic related to your data, making it reusable and centralized.
 e)Interaction: Provide data to views and templates, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.

 Views are responsible for;

 a) 1. Handling Requests
 HTTP Requests: Views process HTTP requests from users and return HTTP responses. Each view corresponds to a specific URL endpoint.
 Request Processing: Views handle the logic of processing user input, interacting with models, and determining what data to send to templates.
    2. Connecting Models and Templates
 Data Retrieval: Views retrieve data from models (the database) and pass it to templates for rendering.
 Data Formatting: Views prepare and format the data needed by templates, ensuring that the right information is displayed to the user.
    3. Business Logic
 Processing Logic: Views contain the logic for processing user actions, such as form submissions, authentication, and other interactions.
 Conditional Logic: Views handle different scenarios and conditions based on user input and application state.
    4. Generating Responses
 Rendering Templates: Views render templates with the data retrieved from models, generating the HTML content sent to the user's browser.
 Redirecting: Views can redirect users to different URLs after certain actions, such as form submissions or login.
 
22) URL Dispatcher - firstly the URL will come the project and then will be directed towards the urls file of app and then to views.py or whatever the path is specified.
